# Vessel Analytics SQL Project

This project is a complete SQL-based analytics workflow for vessel movement data. It includes table creation, data loading, query execution, performance tuning using PostgreSQL settings, and indexing strategies. While the original data is not available, dummy `.csv` files can be used to simulate the execution.

## 📘 Project Overview

The goal is to analyze vessel movement data using PostgreSQL, focusing on performance improvements via memory tuning, CPU parallelism, and indexing. Each query explores a different aspect of the dataset — from tracking signals to filtering vessel types and speeds.

## 📊 Schema Description

There are three main tables:

- **Vessels**: Basic info about each vessel (e.g., ID, type, flag).
- **Positions**: Timestamped location and speed info. Positions.csv file contains only a tiny portion of original data.
- **VesselTypes**: Description of vessel types.

## 🛠️ PostgreSQL Features Used

- `COPY ... WITH CSV HEADER` for bulk data import.
- `VACUUM FULL` for statistics refresh.
- `EXPLAIN` for analyzing execution plans.
- `ALTER SYSTEM SET` to increase RAM and worker parallelism.
- `CREATE INDEX` to enhance performance.

## ⚙️ Performance Tuning Steps

The same queries were run in four different stages:

1. **Baseline** — no system tuning.
2. **Increased RAM** — via `work_mem`.
3. **Increased parallel workers** — via `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`.
4. **With indexes** — manually added indexes based on query patterns.

## 🔍 Analytical Queries

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Query 1 | Count of unique positions per date |
| Query 2 | Group count of Greek-flagged vessels by type |
| Query 3 | Count of vessels with speed > 30 by type |
| Query 4 | Daily count of passenger ships |
| Query 5a | Anchored cargo ships during 15-18 Aug (speed = 0 or NULL at least once) |
| Query 5b | Stationary cargo ships for full 12-19 Aug period (no movement at all) |

## 📎 How to Run Locally

1. Start PostgreSQL and create your DB.
2. Run all SQL files in `schema/` and `config/`.
3. Copy `.csv` files into the correct tables using `COPY` commands. Alter Copy_With_CSV_Header.sql file according to your needs.
4. Execute queries from `queries/` and analyze performance with `EXPLAIN`.

## 📈 EXPLAIN Plan Observations

- After indexing and tuning, query execution times reduced by up to **99%**.
- Example: Query 5b dropped from 4.6s to 0.2s.
- Index-only scans and faster joins were used post-optimization.

## 🧩 Future Work

- Add Python or Jupyter notebooks for visualizing query results.
- Automate benchmarking with timing scripts.
- Support real-time ingestion (e.g., via Kafka or streaming pipelines).
